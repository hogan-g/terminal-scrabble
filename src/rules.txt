1. The game can be played by 2-4 players #
2. The game starts with each player filling their rack with 7 letter tiles #
3. The first player combines two or more of his or her letters to form a word and places 
   it on the board to read either across or down with one letter on the center square. Diagonal words are not allowed. #
4. Complete your turn by submitting, the word score for that turn will be added to your score. 
   Then refill your rack will be refilled to 7 unless there are not enough letters in the tile bag. #
5. Play passes to the next player. The next player, and then each in turn, adds one or more letters to 
   those already played to form new words. All letters played on a turn must be placed in one row across 
   or down the board, to form at least one complete word. If, at the same time, they touch others letters 
   in adjacent rows, those must also form complete words, crossword fashion, with all such letters. 
   The player gets full credit for all words formed or modified on their turn. #
6. New words may be formed by: 
  - Adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the board. 
  - Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board. The new word must use one of the letters 
    already on the board or must add a letter to it. 
  - Placing a complete word parallel to a word already played so that adjacent letters also form complete words. #
7. No tile may be shifted or replaced after it has been played and scored. #
8. Blanks: The two blank tiles may be used as any letters. When playing a blank, you must state which letter 
   it represents. It remains that letter for the rest of the game. #
9. You may use a turn to exchange all of your letters, your letters will be added back to the bag, then you 
   draw 7 letters. This ends your turn. #
10. The game ends when all letters have been drawn and one player uses his or her last letter; or when all possible plays have been made. #
